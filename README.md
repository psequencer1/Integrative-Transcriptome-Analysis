The present study was designed to identify potential molecular biomarkers including mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs with the highest value for targeted therapy, prognosis and diagnosis in CRC patients (across all stages), which is really a trend and novel in cancer research for the very recent years. In this regard, we performed a multilayer and integrative computational analysis as follow: 
We have used to set of microarrays and RNA-seq datasets to analyze and determine robust genes in each stage. Then, the combination of significant DEGs determined by RRA and WGCNA in each stage of CRC (stage I to IV) were considered as stage-specific genes. Moreover, the intersection between RRA and WGCNA with a multi cut-off criteria was considered as conserved hub genes across all CRC stages. Finally, we further explore the biological significance of stage-specific genes and hub genes in the downstream analyses to identify potential therapeutic targets (using proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) and non-coding RNA regulatory networks), potential biomarkers for prognosis (using survival analysis) and diagnosis (using different machine learning and deep learning algorithms). Finally, we used clinical samples to carry out validation of a potential and novel target in CRC. Here, we shared all source codes used in this study.
